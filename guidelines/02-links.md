## Rules

All links within copy should appear in [Helvetica, arial, sans-serif, blue and underlined](http://www.kcc.edu/offices-services/marketing/guidelines-templates/instructions/styling/Pages/style-guide.aspx#). This will only happen if the text has been correctly formatted as Body Text.

Links should pop up in a new tab/window when they point to:

-   Other KCC sites not in SharePoint (Fastpath, Seniors, Juniors, etc.)
-   Documents or forms that are in PDF format
-   External website, like YouTube, etc.

### Links within Text

Use the target page’s title as the link text, rather than words such as "Click here" or "More."

***Incorrect:** "For more information about Student Venturing, [click here](http://www.kcc.edu/offices-services/marketing/guidelines-templates/instructions/styling/Pages/style-guide.aspx#)."*
***Correct:** "See [Student Venturing](http://www.kcc.edu/offices-services/marketing/guidelines-templates/instructions/styling/Pages/style-guide.aspx#) for more information."*

### Title (Hover) Text

In order to comply with accessibility standards and boost the page’s SEO, all links should have title text, also called “hover” or “mouseover” text. The title text can be updated in the “Description” field under **Link Tools > Format**.

Title text should be written to give the user additional context for the link destination. For example, title text for an email link or faculty profile would say:

-   For more information, [email Professor John Smith](http://www.kcc.edu/offices-services/marketing/guidelines-templates/instructions/styling/Pages/style-guide.aspx# "Send email")\\
(the title text is “Send email”)
-   [Professor John Smith](http://www.kcc.edu/offices-services/marketing/guidelines-templates/instructions/styling/Pages/style-guide.aspx# "View faculty profile") has been in the Entrepreneurship division for 38 years ...
(the title text is “View faculty profile”)

When linking to an external site (even if KCC "owns" it), the destination URL can be the title text.

-   For more information, visit [Entrepreneurship of All Kinds](http://www.kcc.edu/offices-services/marketing/guidelines-templates/instructions/styling/Pages/style-guide.aspx# "www.eak.org")™\\
(the title text is "www.eak.org")
-   [The Goldman Sachs Foundation](http://www.kcc.edu/offices-services/marketing/guidelines-templates/instructions/styling/Pages/style-guide.aspx# "www.goldmansachs.com/foundation")
(the title text is "www.goldmansachs.com/foundation/")

If the link copy is written correctly and the link is pointing to an internal page, title text could be redundant and may be omitted. If you feel you need to add title text, something simple such as “Learn more” is enough—it’s less confusing than repeating the link text.

***Incorrect:** “See [Student Venturing](http://www.kcc.edu/offices-services/marketing/guidelines-templates/instructions/styling/Pages/style-guide.aspx# "Student Venturing") for more information.” (the title text is the same as the link text)*\\
***Correct:** “See [Student Venturing](http://www.kcc.edu/offices-services/marketing/guidelines-templates/instructions/styling/Pages/style-guide.aspx#) for more information.” (the title text has been omitted)*\\
***Correct:** “See [Student Venturing](http://www.kcc.edu/offices-services/marketing/guidelines-templates/instructions/styling/Pages/style-guide.aspx# "Learn more") for more information.” (the title text is “Learn more”)*

### Linking to a File

When linking to a file:

"(pdf)" should appear within the links:

-   ***Incorrect:** [Example](http://www.kcc.edu/offices-services/marketing/guidelines-templates/instructions/styling/Pages/style-guide.aspx#) (pdf)*
-   ***Correct:** [Example (pdf)](http://www.kcc.edu/offices-services/marketing/guidelines-templates/instructions/styling/Pages/style-guide.aspx#)*

Use the file’s title, rather than the filename, as the link text.

-   ***Incorrect:** "For more information, download [April 14, 11 color flyer .pdf](http://www.kcc.edu/offices-services/marketing/guidelines-templates/instructions/styling/Pages/style-guide.aspx#)."*
-   ***Correct:** "For more information, download [Integrating Project Management and Service Management (pdf)](http://www.kcc.edu/offices-services/marketing/guidelines-templates/instructions/styling/Pages/style-guide.aspx#)."*

Include the lowercase file type in parentheses immediately following the title, as part of the link.

-   ***Incorrect:** "For more information, download [Integrating Project Management and Service Management (PDF)](http://www.kcc.edu/offices-services/marketing/guidelines-templates/instructions/styling/Pages/style-guide.aspx#)."*
-   ***Correct:** "For more information, download [Integrating Project Management and Service Management (pdf)](http://www.kcc.edu/offices-services/marketing/guidelines-templates/instructions/styling/Pages/style-guide.aspx#)."*

Be sure the file opens in a new window or tab by clicking the "Open in a new tab" checkbox under **Link Tools > Format**

Top level directories on KCC site should use the full url path while sub sites and individual pages must only be followed by a single forward slash.
