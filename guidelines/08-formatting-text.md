## Rules
### FORMATTING TEXT
This guide is to help you edit and shape text in a format acceptable to SharePoint. Please follow our Style Guide to create a consistent and uniform look for kcc.edu.

For the most part, the Ribbon and all of its Editing Tools are all you will ever need to edit text. The Ribbon resembles other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Word.

Please follow these steps after all the content has been typed/inserted onto your page. By default, if pasted as plain text, your text will inherit the paragraph <p> style.

#### Headers

Go through your page and highlight any headers to style them using pre-existing styles.

-   The top-level title of a page is H1. There should only be one H1 per page.
-   Primary headings are then H2, H3, and so on until the lowest-level heading H6. You can have more than one H2-H6 per page.
-   Large Intro Text is the style for the introduction line of the page, which appears below the H1.

#### Other Text Styling

All text styles are already defined into the content management system, so you'll never have to remember font styles, sizes, colors, etc. However, you may want to apply certain other formatting to the page. These formatting options can be found within the "Format Text" tab and should only include the following:

-   Bold
-   Italics
-   Subscript
-   Superscript
-   Bullets
-   Numbers
