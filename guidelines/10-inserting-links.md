## Rules
### INSERTING LINKS
There are four types of links you can add to a page:

-   A link to an internal SharePoint page
-   A link to an externa​​l webpage
-   A link to a document
-   A link to an emai​​l

Please make sure to follow our [Style Guide](http://www.kcc.edu/offices-services/marketing/guidelines-templates/instructions/styling/Pages/style-guide.aspx#Links "Visit Style Guide") when formatting links.

#### Linking Internally

**Step 1**:

Highlight the linkable text or image.

Please note that if you are linking to a document, such as a .pdf, you must label your link with the file type to inform users before they select the link: [Example (pdf)](#)

**Step 2**:

Within the INSERT tab, select: Insert > Link > From SharePoint

**Step 3**:

A window showing the entire site file structure will display. Navigate to the correct section's "Pages" folder to find your link. Select the link from the list of pages. Be sure the filename is highlighted in blue and the filename also appears in the Location (URL) field at the bottom of the display window.

**Step 4**:

The LINK tab will then appear and will display the URL.

***Note**: The URL will not display "<http://www.kcc.edu>" but rather only the section of the URL following it, starting with a forward-slash: /*

**Step 5**:

The “Description” text represents the title text (or hover text) of the link. Use text that is actionable, such as Apply, Register, Visit Website, etc.

***Note**: You do not need to have these pages "Open in new tab" since they fall within kcc.edu.*

#### Linking Externally

***Note**: External links include any URLs outside of www.kcc.edu (including kcc Blogs, the kcc Calendar, portals, kcc Athletics, etc.).*

**Step 1**:

Highlight the linkable text or image.

**Step 2**:

Within the INSERT tab, select: Link > From Address​

![Link From SharePoint](/img/inserting-links_external.jpg)

**Step 3**:

In the pop-up window, type or copy and paste the webpage address you wish to link to. This should be a link to a non-SharePoint website (e.g. kcc Blogs, Athletics, portals, etc.), or to a non-kcc external website (e.g. Google, Bloomberg Businessweek, peer organizations, etc.),

***Tip**: You can test hyperlinks before linking them by selecting "Test Link" - the webpage will open in a new window.*

**Step 4**:

The “Description” text represents the title text (or hover text) of the link. Use text that is actionable, such as Apply, Register, Visit Website, etc.​

Since this is a link to a non-SharePoint website or to a non-kcc external website, you must check the “Open in New Tab” box.

Then, click anywhere in the content to exit the LINK tab and resume editing. If you wish to test your link, select "Save."

#### Linking to a Document

**Step 1**:

Follow the instructions on how to [upload files](http://www.kcc.edu/offices-services/marketing/guidelines-templates/instructions/styling/Pages/upload-files.aspx "How to Upload PDF Files").

**Step 2**:

Highlight the linkable text. Label your text with the file type (in parantheses next to the text) to inform users before they select it: [Example (pdf)](#)

**Step 3**:

Within the INSERT tab, select: Link > From SharePoint

**Step 4**:

A window showing the entire site file structure will display. Navigate to the correct section's "Documents" folder to find your link. Select the link from the list of pages. Be sure the filename is highlighted in blue and the filename also appears in the Location (URL) field at the bottom of the display window.

**Step 5**:

The LINK tab will then appear and will display the URL.

Note: The URL will not display "<http://www.kcc.edu>" but rather only the section of the URL following it, starting with a forward-slash: /

**Step 5**:

The “Description” text represents the title text (or hover text) of the link. Use text that is actionable, such as Apply, Register, etc.. Typically, documents should use "Download" as the title text.

Since this link is not to webpage within www, check the “Open in New Tab” box.

Then, click anywhere in the content to exit the LINK tab and resume editing. If you wish to test your link, select "Save."

Linking Email Addresses

**Step 1**:

Highlight the name of the person you wish to link to.

**Step 2**:

Within the INSERT tab, select: Link > From Address​

Link From SharePoint
**Step 3**:

In the pop-up window type "mailto:" followed by the person's email address (e.g. mailto:webservices@kcc.edu).

**Step 4**:

The URL should appear as the "mailto:" address you entered in the pop-up window (e.g. mailto:webservices@kcc.edu).

In the “Description" field, type in "Send Email."

Then, click anywhere in the content to exit the LINK tab and resume editing. If you wish to test your link, select "Save."
