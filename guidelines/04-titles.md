## Rules

Information specifically pertaining to H1 tags, otherwise known as page titles.

-   Titles should match the page contents, and should be neither too narrow nor too broad.
-   Titles should be short.
-   Never use periods or exclamation points.
-   Do not use a, an, or the as the first word (Economy of the Second Empire, not The Economy of the Second Empire), unless by convention it is an inseparable part of a name (The Hague).
-   Titles should be nouns or noun phrases (nominal groups): "Early Life," not "In Early Life."
-   Avoid special characters such as the slash (/), plus sign (+),   braces ({ }), and square brackets (\[ \]); use and instead of an ampersand (&amp;), unless the ampersand is an accepted part of a name (Emerson, Lake & Palmer).
-   The final visible character of a title should not be a punctuation mark, unless the punctuation is part of a name (Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!), an abbreviation is used (Inverness City F.C.), or a closing round bracket or quotation mark is required (John Palmer (schooner).
-   Titles and subheads should be set in title case; the capitalization of text in which the first letter of each major word is set in capital.
    -   Always capitalize the first and last word.
    -   Capitalize all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and subordinate conjunctions (as, because, although).
    -   Lowercase all articles, coordinate conjunctions (and, or, nor), and prepositions regardless of length, when they are other than the first or last word.
    -   Lowercase the "to" in an infinitive.
    -   Capitalize hyphenated and open compounds. Capitalize the second word attached by a hyphen to prefixes only if they are proper nouns or proper adjectives.
-   Do not set any titles or subtitles in all caps (uppercase)â€”if the head needs to be uppercase SharePoint will format the subhead automatically.
