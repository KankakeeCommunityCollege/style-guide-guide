## Rules

### INSERTING IMAGES
Use this guide to upload an image from your computer to SharePoint, and insert it into a page layout.

#### Image File Formats and Naming

Your image should be saved at the optimal size and format for it’s intended spot in the layout. The preferred file formats for images used on the web are \*.jpg, \*.gif. and \*.png. Jpg (JPEG) files are best for photographs or images with gradients. GIFs are best used for simple line art, such as logos. PNG files can handle either of those types of images, but since the png file sizes are generally larger than jpg and gif, the best use of png files is when you want to place an image over a colored background because pngs can be saved with a transparent background.

#### Minimum image widths and resolution

The minimum width of an image needs to be 370px (pixels), when the image is saved at a minimum of 72 dpi. A 370px-wide image is optimal for either the left or right column (also known as the Auxiliary Zone or Auxiliary Sub Zone), or up to half the main column, with or without content in the right column.

The minimum width of an image intended to run the full width of the main column needs to be 456px at 72 dpi (if there is content in the right column), or 692px at 72 dpi (if there is no content in the right column).

The way our pages are designed it doesn’t matter what the image’s height is because the pages are scrollable up and down.

The minimum image resolution is 72 dpi (dots per inch).
