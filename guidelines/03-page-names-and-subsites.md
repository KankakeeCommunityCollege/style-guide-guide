## Terminology
URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
: The address of a web site or file on the web.

Host name
: www.kcc.edu is the server host name for kcc.edu.

Domain name
: kcc.edu is the domain name for kcc.edu.

Directory
: A container for a group of files, also known as a folder on some systems.

Top Level Directory
: A directory that exists at the top level of the site structure and so immediately follows the host name, separated by a slash.

Sub-directory
: A directory that exists within another directory.

## Rules

### Directory naming conventions

Directory and filenames should be lowercase and should not contain special characters like &, @, *, et. al. Directory names should be a single word whenever possible, or hyphenated words if more are needed for clarity (e.g. /values/, /history/, /strategic-plan/, /curriculum-innovation/)

Page names should be short, hyphenated if using more than one word, and contain only words that are essential for clarity (e.g. ferpa.aspx, eligibility.aspx, eligibility-date.aspx, apply-for-aid.aspx, course-withdrawals.aspx)

Make sure to change all top level subsite pages (default.aspx) to home.aspx

Top level directories on KCC site should use the full url path while sub sites and individual pages must only be followed by a single forward slash.
