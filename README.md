# Style Guide Guide

Style Guide Guide is a customized style guide for KCC's design system.

## How it works
Style Guide Guide is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator which works quite well for managing the content of a style guide.

## Getting Started
1.  Download or clone the files from the [repository on Github](https://github.com/KankakeeCommunityCollege/style-guide-guide).
2.  In the command line, navigate to the root of the project and run the `jekyll serve` command. This will build the static site and watch for changes.
3.  Visit `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` in your browser to see the style guide.
